## 2D and 3D Cross-Platform AI-Powered Game Engine

**[PlumAI](https://plumai.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine enhanced with artificial intelligence to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [advanced tools](https://plumai.org/features), allowing
developers to focus on making games without reinventing the wheel. Leveraging AI, the engine automates routine tasks, optimizes performance, and offers intelligent suggestions. Games can
be exported with one click to numerous platforms, including major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.plumai.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, Open Source, and Community-Driven

PlumAI is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://plumai.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Your games are yours, down
to the last line of engine code. The engine's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape the engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [PlumAI Foundation](https://plumaifoundation.org/)
not-for-profit organization.

Before being open-sourced in **October 2023**, PlumAI was developed by [Jane Doe](https://github.com/janedoe) and
[John Smith](https://github.com/johnsmith) (both still maintaining the project)
over several years as an in-house engine used to publish multiple successful titles.
